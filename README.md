# Assignment 15 – Core Algorithms, Metrics & Model Behavior

This project implements fundamental machine learning algorithms and evaluation techniques using the Titanic dataset. The focus is on understanding model behavior, regression and classification metrics, and concepts of overfitting and underfitting.

## Dataset

- Dataset: Titanic  
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data  
- Regression Target: Fare  
- Classification Target: Survived  

The same dataset used in previous assignments is reused as required.

## Libraries Used

- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

No hyperparameter tuning was performed.

## Tasks Implemented

### Regression
- Linear Regression model to predict Fare  
- Train-test split and predictions  
- Plot of actual vs predicted values  
- Evaluation using MAE, MSE, and RMSE

### Classification
- Logistic Regression  
- Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors with three k values  
- Comparison of model performance

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Classification report and confusion matrix

### Model Behavior
- Demonstration of underfitting and overfitting  
- Train vs test accuracy comparison  
- Conceptual explanation of bias and variance
